# Micecraft
2D block based module inside Transformice.

Notes about building the Module:
1. You first must clone the repository into your device.
2. After that, run the `merger.lua` file, found under the `build` directory.
3. A new file called 'micecraft.lua' will appear on the `build` directory, which then can be loaded in Transformice.
4. You can log different builds toggling the `shouldLog` parameter on the `merger.lua` file.

Stable releases may be found on the `main` branch, while active developing versions may be found on the `development` branch.
